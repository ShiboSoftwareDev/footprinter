# hc49 Footprint Documentation

This footprint renders an HC49 package with a curved silkscreen delineation and two plated through‐holes. It uses a U‑curve to form rounded corners on the silkscreen outline.

---

## Syntax

```
hc49_w{w}_h{h}_p{p}_id{id}_od{od}
```

Example usage in a footprint string:
- `hc49_w5.6mm_h3.5mm_p4.88mm_id0.6mm_od1.2mm`

Alternatively, you can supply an object with the following properties:
- fn: string (must be `"hc49"`)
- p: pitch between plated holes
- id: plated hole inner diameter
- od: plated hole outer diameter
- w: package width
- h: package height

---

## Example

```tsx
import { fp } from "src/footprinter"

// Using a footprint string
const circuitJson = fp.string("hc49_w5.6mm_h3.5mm_p4.88mm_id0.6mm_od1.2mm").circuitJson()

// Alternatively, specifying parameters via an object:
const circuitJson = fp
  .hc49()
  .w("5.6mm")
  .h("3.5mm")
  .p("4.88mm")
  .id("0.6mm")
  .od("1.2mm")
  .soup()
```

---

## Defaults

- **p (pitch):** `4.88mm`
- **id (inner diameter):** `0.6mm`
- **od (outer diameter):** `1.2mm`
- **w (width):** `5.6mm`
- **h (height):** `3.5mm`

---

## Notes

- **Plated Holes:** Two plated holes are created at positions (–p/2, 0) and (p/2, 0) using the specified inner and outer diameters.
- **Silkscreen Outline:**  
  - A U‑curve is generated on both the left and right sides using a helper function.  
  - The left curve is formed using a U‑curve with center at (–w/2, 0) and the right curve at (w/2, 0).  
  - The overall silkscreen path is then built by concatenating the left curve, its reversed segment, bottom and top straight segments, followed by the right curve and closing with the remaining edges.
- **Reference Text:** A silkscreen reference text is added at position (0, p/4) with a font size of 0.5.
- All components (plated holes, silkscreen path, and reference text) are merged into the resulting circuit JSON.
