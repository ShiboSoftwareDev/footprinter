# ms012 Footprint

## Syntax

```ts
ms012(raw_params: z.input<typeof ms012_def>) => { circuitJson: AnyCircuitElement[]; parameters: any }
```

Define an MS012 footprint by providing optional overrides. By default, the function uses the SOIC footprint template extended with these defaults:

- `p`: "1.27mm" (pin pitch)
- `w`: "3.9mm" (body width)
- `legsoutside`: true  
- `num_pins`: forced to 8

A typical footprint string could be of the form:  
`ms0128_w3.9mm_p1.27mm`  
where the number indicates the fixed number of pins (8) and the width and pitch are set per the defaults unless overridden.

## Examples

- **Example 1:**  
  `ms0128_w3.9mm_p1.27mm`  
  This creates an MS012 footprint with 8 pins, a body width of 3.9mm, and a pin pitch of 1.27mm.

- **Example 2:**  
  You may also supply additional parameters from the underlying SOIC definition (such as `pl` for pad length and `pw` for pad width) if needed.

## Defaults

- **num_pins:** 8 (always set to 8)
- **p (pitch):** "1.27mm"
- **w (width):** "3.9mm"
- **legsoutside:** true  
  (Indicates that the pins extend outside the main body.)

## Notes

- This footprint function builds on the SOIC definition by using `extendSoicDef`, thereby inheriting all common SOIC parameters (for example, pad length `pl` and pad width `pw`).
- The function overrides or forces `num_pins` to 8 regardless of input, ensuring that the MS012 footprint always has 8 pins.
- The footprint output consists of a Circuit JSON representation generated by calling `soicWithoutParsing` on the parsed parameters.
- Any additional overrides provided in `raw_params` will update the corresponding properties used in the SOIC footprint generation.
